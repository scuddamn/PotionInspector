  titleL: Potion Effects
  bodyL: <align="left">Just because an alchemist has told you that they've handed
    you a healing potion, doesn't mean that potion will ACTUALLY be a healing potion.
    People lie! It's your job to figure out the truth.
  titleR: Potion Effects
  bodyR: <align="left">While sampling the potion is the easiest way to understand
    what the potion does, it doesn't always tell you everything you wish to know.
    You can narrow down the potion's effect to sub-categories within each potion
    TYPE. Check each type category page for more info.
