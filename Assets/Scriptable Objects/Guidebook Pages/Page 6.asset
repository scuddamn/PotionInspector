  titleL: Potion Effects
  bodyL: Just because an alchemist has told you that they've handed you a healing
    potion, doesn't mean that potion will ACTUALLY be a healing potion. People lie!
    It's your job to figure out the truth.
  titleR: Potion Effects
  bodyR: While sampling the potion is the easiest way to understand what the potion
    does, it doesn't always tell you everything you wish to know. You can narrow
    down the potion's effect to sub-categories within each potion TYPE. Check each
    type category page for more info.
