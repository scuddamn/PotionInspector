  titleL: Introduction
  bodyL: '<align="left">Welcome to the Potion Market: the largest purveyor of alchemical
    goods this side of where we are! Demand is getting higher lately, so we put out
    a call to every alchemist in the land, and every day, they show up with potions
    to sell! '
  titleR: Introduction
  bodyR: "<align=\"left\">\u2026Unfortunately, this has led to a massive increase
    in potion-adjacent deaths! After last month, when some of our customers allegedly
    exploded, we formed the Potion and Elixir Consumer Safety Association (PECSA)
    to inspect every single potion before it can be sold! Congratulations to you
    as our newest Potion Inspector! Thanks for helping us keep our customers safe
    and happy (and alive)!"
