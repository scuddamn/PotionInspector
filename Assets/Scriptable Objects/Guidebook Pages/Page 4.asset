  bodyL: '<align="left">The strength of a potion can vary from weak (minimal effect)
    to strong (maximum effect). You have been provided with a Gleaning Candle (one
    of your TOOLS), which can tell you how strong a potion is.

    Just place a
    drop of the potion onto the candle and look at the flame! (Pipette also included
    in your TOOLS)'
